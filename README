 The following HTML/CSS files describe a regular UI design from a tube thumbnailing 
 page. The sliced design provided is built upon the 978 Grid System based on the 
 HTML5 Boilerplate foundation and includes a responsive header so specific CSS 
 styling is applied depending on each resolution.

 The current design supports the 978, 1218 and 1378 grid systems. This supposes a wide
 support for almost any screen resolution equal or higher than 1024 pixels width. As
 mentioned above the layour is fully responsive (but not adaptive) thanks to a set of
 CSS media queries included in the <head> tag.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 CREATING NEW THEMES/SKINS
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Skinning and applying new UI themes is a simple and straightforward task.
 To do so, just replicate one of the available folders lcoated at the /themes 
 main directory. Each folder contains up to 10 files and 1 stylesheet. The bitmaps
 provided define the look & feel for the theme defined in the folder.
 
 Once replicated rename your just-created folder accordingly to the theme you want
 to deploy and open it. Update the image files you require (you may update all 
 or just a subset of them) but make sure to keep the original name.
 
 Once finished editing the bitmaps, open the stylesheet. The CSS rules provided are 
 divided into two separate blocks. The first block encompasses all the CSS rules 
 that define the overall text & link colors (and some border colors as well). Just
 update this first block and leave the second block as is UNLESS you have modified any 
 filename and need to point to it the corresponding CSS rule.
 
 Now that you have created a new set of files defining a new UI theme just reference
 it in the page header. Look for the following code snippet:
 
 <!--
  	[ DEV NOTES ]
    Update the following stylesheet reference to switch the current UI theme
  -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/themes/pink/theme.css">
  
  And replace the HREF url with your theme´s folder location. That´s all. Easy, uh?
  
  ADVICE: In case you plan to deploy several themes and want to save time on the
  color customisation tasks, may be you shoudl consider isolating colors into variables
  and apply them with a variable/mixin frrameworks targected to CSS. The LESS framework
  is specially addressed to work around these problems and its use is specially advised in 
  case of huge overhead.

 SIDEBAR
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 The layout supports in the body DIV a side bar contianing links. In order
 to remove the sidebar adn have the remaining eklements positioning 
 accordingly to the new width available, just remove the 'with-sidebar'
 in the "centerContent" DOM element.
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 NOTES REGARDING THUMBNAIL 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Chances are that the video thumbnails will change over time. In this case,
 changes will be required in order to have the grid adapting properly to the new 
 thumbnail sizes. Any thumbnail size exceeding the container size 
 will remain hidden by default.
 
 Thumbnails are displayed accordingly to the page width and UI layout, bearing in mind
 that there is a sidebar grabbing space from the body container or not. Specific CSS rules
 affecting to the thumbnails margin/padding/width are included in each resolution-specific
 stylesheet.
 
 Everytime the thumbnail size is modified, just update the width/margin/padding values
 available in each resolution stylesheet (notes pointing to the specific rules have been
 included for your convenience) until the final layout matches your desired look&feel for these
 new sizes.
